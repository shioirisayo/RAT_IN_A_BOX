# Demos

In this folder we provide numerous "example scripts" or "demos" which will help when learning `RatInABox`. 
All demos can be run in Google Colab but, for best performance, it is recommended to use a local IDE. 

In approximate order of complexity, these include:
* [simple_example.ipynb](./simple_example.ipynb): a very simple tutorial for importing RiaB, initilising an Environment, Agent and some PlaceCells, running a brief simulation and outputting some data. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/RatInABox/blob/dev/demos/simple_example.ipynb)
* [extensive_example.ipynb](./extensive_example.ipynb): a more involved tutorial. More complex enivornment, more complex cell types and more complex plots are used. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/RatInABox/blob/dev/demos/extensive_example.ipynb)
* [list_of_plotting_functions.md](./list_of_plotting_fuctions.md): All the types of plots available for are listed and explained. 
* [readme_figures.ipynb](./readme_figures.ipynb): (Almost) all plots/animations shown in the root readme are produced from this script (plus some minor formatting done afterwards in powerpoint). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/RatInABox/blob/dev/demos/readme_figures.ipynb)
* [paper_figures.ipynb](./paper_figures.ipynb): (Almost) all plots/animations shown in the paper are produced from this script (plus some major formatting done afterwards in powerpoint). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/RatInABox/blob/dev/demos/paper_figures.ipynb)
* [decoding_position_example.ipynb](./decoding_position_example.ipynb): Postion is decoded from neural data generated with RatInABox using linear regression. Place cells, grid cell and boundary vector cells are compared. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/RatInABox/blob/dev/demos/decoding_position_example.ipynb)
* [reinforcement_learning_example.ipynb](./reinforcement_learning_example.ipynb): RatInABox is use to construct, train and visualise a small two-layer network capable of model free reinforcement learning in order to find a reward hidden behind a wall. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/RatInABox/blob/dev/demos/reinforcement_learning_example.ipynb) 
* [path_integration_example.ipynb](./path_integration_example.ipynb): RatInABox is use to construct, train and visualise a large multi-layer network capable of learning a "ring attractor" capable of path integrating a position estimate using only velocity inputs.
